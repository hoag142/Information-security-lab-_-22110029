# 4.2 Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC

Split the BMP file into its header and body using `dd`.

*Recognition of Shapes:*

- Despite the encryption, the dolphin shape is still visible. This is because ECB mode encrypts identical plaintext blocks to identical ciphertext blocks. Therefore, any repeating pattern in the image results in a repeating pattern in the encrypted output.
*Pattern Leakage:*

- The structure and edges of the dolphin are recognizable. This happens because ECB does not alter the block patterns, meaning regions of the image that are the same before encryption remain visibly similar after encryption.
*Color Artifacts:*

- The encrypted image displays strange color bands and artifacts. These are caused by the encryption of individual blocks without consideration for adjacent blocks, leading to a non-uniform and patchy appearance.

***Explaination:***

ECB mode encrypts each block of data independently, which is effective for text data but not for image data where patterns are crucial. In images, the visual continuity means that blocks are often similar, leading to the same encrypted blocks and hence visible patterns.


- **Encrypt using AES-256-CBC**:

The image will typically appear as random noise or scrambled patterns. This is due to CBC mode’s chaining effect and randomization.

**Conclusion:**

- **ECB Mode** <span style="color: lightBlue ;">often shows recognizable patterns or blocks from the original image because it encrypts each block of plaintext independently.</span>
- **CBC Mode** <span style="color: lightBlue;">provides better visual results because it uses an initialization vector and ensures that each block of plaintext is affected by previous blocks.</span>

# 4.3 Encryption Mode – Corrupted Cipher Text 

## **1. Create a text file that is at least 64 bytes long**
  
  Use the `dd` command to create a file filled with random data

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0b93634-043c-4ef2-93b0-4134e7be35b8)
 ## **2. Encrypt the file using the AES-256 cipher in ECB and CBC Modes.**

  Encrypt the file using different modes: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB. For each mode :

- <span style="color: coral;">**With ECB**</span>

  ```openssl enc -aes-256-ecb -nosalt -in long_text.txt -out ecb_encrypted_long_text.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF```

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f20252cd-2100-42fd-ba4a-ee6b2de1063e)


- <span style="color: coral;">**With CBC**</span>

  ```openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -nosalt -in long_text.txt -out cbc_encrypted_long_text.txt -K 00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF -iv 0102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F10```

  ## **3. Introduce Corruption in the Encrypted File**
 
  Use the `dd` command to corrupt a single bit of the 5th byte in the encrypted file

- <span style="color: coral;">**Corrupt ECB Encrypted File**</span>


```
dd if=ecb_encrypted_long_text.txt of=ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt bs=1 count=4 
echo -n -e '\x00' >> ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt
dd if=ecb_encrypted_long_text.txt of=ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt bs=1 skip=5 seek=5
```

- `dd if=ecb_encrypted_long_text.txt of=ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt bs=1 count=4 ` : Copy the first 4 bytes of the original encrypted file to the corrupted file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6823bfad-fccd-4127-bf74-0cda1c1c2710)


- `echo -n -e '\x00' >> ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt` : Introduce a corruption by adding a null byte. The `echo` command with the `-n` option prevents a newline from being added. The `-e` option enables the interpretation of backslash escapes. `\x00` is the hexadecimal representation of a null byte.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5c87105-9ea6-4f29-a752-d1f5aeecd4c6)


- `dd if=ecb_encrypted_long_text.txt of=ecb_corrupted_encrypted_long_text.txt bs=1 skip=5 seek=5` : Copy the rest of the bytes from the original encrypted file to the corrupted file.

**My random text 64 bytes long**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f65f3bb-2638-4e11-ab50-2ea1d2a56bce)

### a. How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, OFB, or CFB?
Expected Answers:

<span style="color: coral;">**ECB**</span>: Only the block with the corrupted byte is affected; other blocks remain intact.

<span style="color: coral;">**CBC**</span>: The corrupted block and the subsequent block are affected; remaining blocks are intact.

<span style="color: coral;">**OFB**</span>: Only the corrupted byte is affected; other bytes remain intact.

<span style="color: coral;">**CFB**</span>: The corrupted byte and subsequent bytes within the same block are affected.

<span style="color: lightGreen;">**checking 4 decrypted file text**:</span>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/579cb9da-a5a1-4ca1-9b6f-b94c94bda071)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bcacc7a-00b3-4183-ae75-a7823def8d66)

- The result of the decrypted is <span style="color: lightBlue;">almost the same</span> as what I expected.

### b. Explain.
<span style="color: coral;">**ECB**</span>: Each block is encrypted independently, so corruption is isolated to the affected block.

<span style="color: coral;">**CBC**</span>: Each block depends on the previous one, so corruption in one block affects the subsequent block.

<span style="color: coral;">**OFB**</span>: Functions like a stream cipher where each byte of plaintext is XORed with a keystream generated from the previous block. Hence, only the corrupted byte is affected.

<span style="color: coral;">**CFB**</span>: Similar to OFB, but operates on a cipher feedback mechanism. Corruption in one byte affects the corresponding byte in the plaintext and propagates to subsequent bytes in the same block.

### c. What is the implication of these differences?
<span style="color: coral;">**ECB**:</span>

*Implication*: Limited error propagation makes it easy to recover from corruption, but this mode is less secure due to pattern repetition in the ciphertext.
Security: Poor, as identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks, making it vulnerable to pattern analysis.

<span style="color: coral;">**CBC**:</span>

*Implication:* Moderate error propagation helps obscure patterns better than ECB but comes with a trade-off: corruption affects more data.
Security: Better than ECB, as the chaining of blocks helps obscure patterns, but still susceptible to bit-flipping attacks within a block.

<span style="color: coral;">**OFB**:</span>

*Implication:* Very limited error propagation, making it easier to recover from corruption. Functions similarly to a stream cipher.
Security: Good for encrypting data streams where error propagation needs to be minimal. No pattern repetition as keystream is independent of plaintext.

<span style="color: coral;">**CFB**:</span>

*Implication:* Error propagation within a block helps obscure patterns but can still propagate errors within the same block.
Security: Good for scenarios requiring bitwise operations and partial block encryption. Better error resilience compared to CBC.
